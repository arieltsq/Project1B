# Project1B - Unicorn the coin thief

**Goal of the Game**

To survive the space, help the Unicorn collect as many coins so that it can power up it's Coin bar aka. health bar!  
You're given 3 lives in this game. However, when you hit the Space Police, your coin bar will regenerate!  
Do remember that once your 3 lives is up, it's Gameover!  
Instead of cmd+R to refresh, you can just press R to refresh the game (That's if it's too hard for you).

**Tips**

1. You can download the source code to use.
2. Do note that I've put in if/else conditions so that the unicorn will not get out of the box!
3. You can set the timer of the health bar that is decreasing by the second in the setInterval(MinusHealth)
